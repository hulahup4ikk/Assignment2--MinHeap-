# Min-Heap (Student A)
Optimized MinHeap Implementation

This branch introduces algorithmic and performance improvements over the base version.

ðŸ”§ New Features & Enhancements

Linear BuildHeap (buildHeap) â€” builds a heap from an array in O(n) time.
Used to make merge operations faster.

Optimized Merge (merge) â€” combines two heaps in O(n + m) instead of O(m log n).

Optimized HeapifyDown â€” reduces redundant array accesses by caching the smallest value.
âœ… 30â€“40 % fewer memory reads.

Memory Tracking â€” adds allocation counting to PerformanceTracker.
